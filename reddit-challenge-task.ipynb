For most of you, stop cherry picking what OP said in the post. If the technician is calling the other doctors by their last name/title and refusing to call OP by it then itâ€™s not a lack of respect, it is active disrespect. As a technician, I would never have disrespected a doctor like that. As a doctor now, I would expect the same respect as my other colleagues. I go by my first name because thatâ€™s how I like it, but as someone who was once a technician, the appropriate thing to do is to call them by their last name/title at first and feel it out or simply ask the what they prefer.\n","\n","For those of you saying that respect is earned, OP earned that shit by completing 8+ years of schooling to get their degree (13+ for some of us).

What should not be acceptable is the nitpicking and hazing that is often given to new grads. There is a way to respectfully give advice.

Those that choose to pay their loans off over the long haul, typically lack some of those two qualities. Or extenuating circumstances create issues paying off loans that fast. The power of simple math fired the ass busters up and they made it happen for themselves.|Yes customers. I spent 10 years in practice. In every role. As a industry consultant I speak with customer, vet clinics, all over the country. I advise them to stay away from and to not hire clown acts like yourself. Just because I currently reside here doesnâ€™t mean my view point would be different if I lived somewhere else. Like when I lived in California for 6 years. Still a consultant in the industry I directed my customer, clients, what have you on how to best run their business. Staying away from problem or toxic employees is at the top of the list.

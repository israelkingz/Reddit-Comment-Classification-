"I think a lot of other people made some good points so I’m not going to repeat a lot of it. It’s never too late to consider vet med as a career and undergrad is a great opportunity to push yourself and make yourself competitive.

I will play devils advocate though. I am a second year resident and I’m burnt out already. Undergrad is 4 years, vet school is another 4, and residency is 3. If you want to do aquatic medicine then it will likely be another 2 years of rotating and specialty internships before residency. That’s upwards of 13 years of training ahead of you. Vet Med can be rewarding, but it is hard and long to get to the end of your training. I’m not saying this to discourage you, but simply to make sure you know what you would be commuting to. You have to be driven and always keep your eye on the prize. Be prepared for long nights, long weeks, and long years.|As someone who knows people looking for path jobs in diagnostics/industry, this information is not current. Most diagnostic centers have placed a hold on hiring and industry has definitely slowed down. Also, pharma almost always requires a concurrent PhD.|Some of these comments are absolutely insane and just speak to how toxic the culture is in vet med. For most of you, stop cherry picking what OP said in the post. If the technician is calling the other doctors by their last name/title and refusing to call OP by it then it’s not a lack of respect, it is active disrespect. As a technician, I would never have disrespected a doctor like that. As a doctor now, I would expect the same respect as my other colleagues. I go by my first name because that’s how I like it, but as someone who was once a technician, the appropriate thing to do is to call them by their last name/title at first and feel it out or simply ask the what they prefer. 

For those of you saying that respect is earned, OP earned that shit by completing 8+ years of schooling to get their degree (13+ for some of us). Did they know everything coming out? No. None of us do. Most of us understand that and are welcome to constructive advice (which I think it’s clear that OP is). What should not be acceptable is the nitpicking and hazing that is often given to new grads. There is a way to respectfully give advice. If you are a technician OR a doctor, this is a useful skill to learn. Technicians know things doctors don’t know and doctors don’t know things technicians know. Instead of belittling each other, they should create an environment where people are open to ask questions and share advice.|I think a lot of other people made some good points so I’m not going to repeat a lot of it.

"If you like the industry but don’t care for the pay an employee in a clinic makes you can always look at industry roles. Idexx,zoetis,Heska,petdesk, there are thousands of veterinary companies out there that offer better pay and allow you to still be in the field. Although not in practice…|There is a lower the dose campaign from idexx. You can find it on the website I am sure. They also sell the only digital radiology system that requires half the radiation dose than that of a traditional system. Pretty cool technology, maybe your clinic is willing to check it out.|Y’all wild. I’ll let y’all continue to swirl around this toilet bowl of a discussion. Sorry to derail your question op. The pile of shit being left here isn’t getting you anywhere closer to finding a worthwhile associate/partner. And to the clown that deleted their posts….foreshame. Internet is full of unworthy trolls and you’ve proven one.|Bless all your hearts. This isn’t a difficult game to figure out. Y’all seem to be too dense to look for a viable solution that involves compromises. Only dvms I know that are unhappy are corporate dvms that have to abide by the corp bullshit that anyone has a dislike for. You ain’t happy where you at then fix it. Quit complying. 

This poor clinic just askin about how to find a vet now has to weed thru all this bullshit for no real answer other than find a non lgbtqia+-= male dvm. Otherwise it seems like a headache.|It is disappointing  to feel like the work ethic of this industry has declined over the last 20 years. 15 years ago new grads could expect base $55k with about 6/7% production. Now they are getting $100k 2/4% production with much better benefits and work life balance. Not to mention the sign on bonus that corporate groups are giving the new grads. All tides turn in time. I think you’ve got a hell of an offer regardless of what the states reproductive rights are.|Touché|When the commenters here merely state TEXAS!?!? Fuck texas and their anti feminist anti gay bullshit? Clearly that’s someone watching too much news and not living day to day here. Op didn’t even mention extended benefits and everyone slammed it as it’s a texas problem. It’s not a texas problem. Obviously it’s a workforce problem when the women are too scared or stubborn or both to come to a place that will pay them fairly. As op stated a pretty fair wage as far as I’m considered and still not knowing exact details.|Never once did I say pull anything up by any bootstraps. Y’all putting words in my mouth. And vary rarely is an abortion life threatening. To wait a week or less to travel to an area that allows it isn’t difficult. Please stay wherever you are and advocate whatever you want. This tribalism of red vs blue is only compounding this and many other issues.|If you can’t abort an unwanted pregnancy shouldn’t you be taking the act of unprotected sex into consideration as well. Don’t want a baby? There’s ways to prevent it to begin with….|You can always travel for repro rights. Not a difficult concept. And most Texans don’t give a shit what you identify as as long as you don’t push your shit on us who cares what you do. Turn the tv off and have some conversations with people. The difference isn’t a wide gap and we tend to agree on most things. Y’all too worried about what msnbc or fox as to say about it. Their are not our puppet, or yours. Quit acting like it. And yeah I do believe the system can change. I’ve seen it happen. I’ve lived the change. To discount a place because of international food? You have clearly never experienced the vast culinary melting pot of many texas cities. Too stuck in your own existence to experience what different places have to offer. Keep yourself where you are it’s your mindset that keeps shit stagnant.|I question your intelligence in the face of your advanced degree. Learn the industry and you may surprise yourself. Fucking clowns.|Supply and demand affect these rates the most. Start hurting for vets the wages go up. Also the type of medicine they practice matter. Small animal vs large animal, ecg.|Soooo if 15 years ago the going rate for a new grad was $55k and now, most places I deal with are offering $100k…… it’s not quite double but pretty darn close. Seems like pay is keeping up with most things. Again you don’t like your current situation, there are others to be had. There is just a lack of doing so for whatever reason you want to point out. I most commonly see what I see.|To say politics is the reason they can’t hire anyone is flat bullshit that only the weak and simple minded allow them to let it affect them like that.|I would question her place of employment instead of the state she lived in. That’s dumb.|I wouldn’t require someone to do something with their body they didn’t want to. It’s not my decision. And if the govt says it’s a must, well time to adapt right? I personally wouldn’t fire someone because they chose to or not to get something that’s voluntary. I helped my people look for alternatives to vaccination. Medical/religious exemptions. Flat saying no thanks no poke for me. I let my people choose. Honestly great point! Maybe we will implement some sort of compensation for women in my org that need to travel to get the medical care they require. I could even implement it for the opposite of women that need help getting pregnant. Looky here something positive from this shit storm.|Lol obviously not. But if I found myself in that situation I’ve got bigger fish to fry than an unwanted pregnancy. If that’s your true worry maybe you should reassess your surroundings…possibly a state that allows open carry of a firearm might deter any unsavory types that could lead to said unwanted pregnancies?|Okurrr. Just look at movement maps during Covid. One of the most blue states, California, had more residents move from there to texas… Jesus y’all need to pop another ssri and chill. How do you think those drugs y’all are on for such a hard life y’all have had affect a fetus?|Never said I wanted them to that it was justified that they made that. It’s much different now especially in my area of texas, the average salary is $100k plus production for even a new grad.|My reason and logic seem to confuse even the most basic of individuals. My intelligence should a always be questioned. As should yours. If we are not flexing the gray matter on a daily basis we are but withering away.|That’s ignorant to leave the industry because your not getting paid what you are worth. Find a place that will pay. They are everywhere. Of the 1000 plus vet clinics in my part of the world 80% are looking for a dvm and will pay $100K + incentives. Open your eyes. Either that or these drs leaving want to work 10-4 with a 2 hour lunch and 2 months pto. Oh and only want vaccine appointments because they aren’t comfortable in sx or more difficult cases. That’s the lack of gumption I speak of.|No one said to take out student loans. I know dvms that floated their schooling and I know ones that did take loans out and paid it off in 3 years because they busted ass. The way some of these commenters are talking they be living at the clinic so what mortgage? (Joking don’t downvote me more). Sure things are more expensive I get that, everyone feels that bite. But if your wages in the profession are up you should still just as easily meet those obligations just as the dvms of 15 years ago did. I’m no math expert but I can do that math.|As the saying goes scared money don’t make money. It’s like saying I won’t work in Houston because of greenspoint. Well why not Conroe instead? Might as well not go to New York either since we ship both the immigrants and our stray dog population there. Oh no, the migrant flow continuesssssss|It’s only hostile to them because they let it be. Ok my state says I can or can’t do something, doesn’t mean I have to abide by that. I bet you never speed do you? That’s the state telling you what you can and can’t do with your body too isn’t it? A bit oversimplified but the same concept. Y’all too worried about red vs blue or they vs them. You do you boo but please stay the fuck away from this state and it’s wonderful people. There’s a saying for a reason, don’t California my Texas. The anger and downvotes I’ve gotten in this thread is hilarious. All the while I just laugh continue about my day. I bet y’all going home and crying to your spouse about the unhinged asshole on Reddit. Cry into your pillow, no one cares.|Idk if you read my last comment. I literally just said I would like to look into compensation for women that require or want such care. It’s not their fault texas has this issue and they shouldn’t suffer, no one should, because of it. I’m not denying anything. If anything I’m looking to facilitate their choice…even would like to go as far as helping the women whom want to become pregnant that can’t… I fail to see your issue here.|Please read above. I stated I helped my people find alternatives. Religious and medical exemptions… I fail to see the issue…|Daily. I welcome it. If I don’t challenge my customers and they don’t challenge me it’s a boring life. Hell, if I don’t challenge myself how boring. I’ll be the first to admit when I’m wrong as well. Hence how I’ve made it to where I am in life and in this industry. Just because I don’t have some advanced degree from some prestigious institution doesn’t mean I lack in intelligence. I’ve given my life to this industry just as many veterinarians have. I’m not so pretentious that I can’t see the Forrest for the trees. This answer is simple. Your undervalued and overworked? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! The clinic you work at isn’t the only one, it’s not your only option. Not in Texas, not in Idaho. No matter where you are or want to be there are many options for yourself. You just have to take the initiative, rely on yourself, no one else.|If you can’t afford to live and work where you currently are, and feel undervalued I would imagine doubling your base salary and increasing your other benefits would entice you to make the move across the country. No high horse just the reality of where I am at. I’m not happy where I’m at or getting paid what I’m worth I’m actively looking for a place I will be satisfied. Simple as that. And maybe they would off themselves if they realized that was an opportunity.|16 I know paid it off within 3 years. All of them in the last 8 years. How did they pay it off within 3 years of graduation you ask? By busting their ass and living below their means. Taking extra shifts at other hospitals. Hell one of them worked in industry, worked overnight ec and lived like they were in college still. It can happen. It does happen. Funny thing is we can circle back to work ethic and gumption. Those that choose to pay their loans off over the long haul, typically lack some of those two qualities. Or extenuating circumstances create issues paying off loans that fast. The power of simple math fired the ass busters up and they made it happen for themselves.|Yes customers. I spent 10 years in practice. In every role. As a industry consultant I speak with customer, vet clinics, all over the country. I advise them to stay away from and to not hire clown acts like yourself. Just because I currently reside here doesn’t mean my view point would be different if I lived somewhere else. Like when I lived in California for 6 years. Still a consultant in the industry I directed my customer, clients, what have you on how to best run their business. Staying away from problem or toxic employees is at the top of the list. If you are a veterinarian I feel terrible for your clients and your business. Maybe it’s not suffering now but a room full of toxic bullshit always boils over.|I haven’t screamed once. And considering I’ve had to weather all types of economic storms I’m pretty well versed on it. Also, thanks for assuming the adversities I have faced in life. But if you must know my back story here’s a snippet. Grew up poor, busted my ass to put myself thru school and worked tirelessly for an industry I love and have literally almost died for. Yet I’m still here fighting the good fight. Politics be damned.|I would check diagnostic and distribution companies. There’s all types of remote dvm roles. Something like idexx, telehealth or corporate veterinary groups. Not sure if any of those are in Germany but it’s worth a shot.",100realtx,Vet,"This person mentions consulting vet clinics. As such they can be considered in the ""vet"" label which includes vets and vet consultants"
